Our paper titled "[Probabilistic Program Verification via Inductive Synthesis of Inductive Invariants](/publication/batz-cegis2023/)" has been accepted for presentation at TACAS 2023 -- the 29th International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems at Paris, France. This paper contributes a simple yet effective inductive synthesis approach for proving quantitative properties of (in)finite-state probabilistic programs by generating inductive invariants on source-code level.
