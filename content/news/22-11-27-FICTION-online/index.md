We have just launched this website for our FICTION research group at ZJU.

<!--more-->

The FICTION website is published by [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/?utm_campaign=poweredby) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/); see [James Wright's post](https://www.jameswright.xyz/post/20200409/deploy_wowchemy_to_githubio/) on automating the deployment. The design is inspired by [Genetic Logic Lab](http://geneticlogiclab.org/).
