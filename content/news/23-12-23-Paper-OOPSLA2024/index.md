Our paper titled "[Exact Bayesian Inference for Loopy Probabilistic Programs using Generating Functions](/publication/klinkenberg-oopsla2024/)" by Lutz Klinkenberg (RWTH Aachen), Christian Blumenthal (RWTH Aachen), {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}}, Darion Haase (RWTH Aachen), and Joost-Pieter Katoen (RWTH Aachen) has been accepted for presentation at OOPSLA 2024 in California, United States, as part of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL). This paper contributes an exact Bayesian inference method for inferring posterior distributions encoded by probabilistic programs featuring possibly unbounded loops.
