Our extended abstract titled "[Latticed Craig Interpolation with an Application to Probabilistic Verification](/publication/yang-cibd2024/)" by {{% mention "Mingqi Yang" %}}, Kevin Batz (RWTH Aachen), {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}}, Joost-Pieter Katoen (RWTH Aachen), {{% mention "Zhiang Wu" %}}, and Jianwei Yin has been accepted for presentation at CIBD 2024 -- the Workshop on Theory and Applications of Craig Interpolation and Beth Definability at Amsterdam, Netherlands. This extended abstract presents our ongoing research in quantitative verification of (infinite-state) probabilistic programs
with potentially unbounded loops leveraging the technique of latticed Craig interpolation.
