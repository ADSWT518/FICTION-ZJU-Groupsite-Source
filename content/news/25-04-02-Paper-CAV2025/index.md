Our paper titled "[On the Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Counter Programs](/publication/NOVOZHILOV-CAV2025/)" by {{% mention "Sergei Novozhilov" %}}, {{% mention "Mingqi Yang" %}}, {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}}, {{% mention "Zhiyang Li" %}}, and Jianwei Yin has been accepted for presentation at CAV 2025 -- the 37th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification, at Zagreb, Croatia. This paper introduces $k$-d PCPs -- the class of *probabilistic counter programs* with $k \in \mathbb{N}$ counter variables inducing possibly infinite-state Markov chains. We show that the universal (positive) almost-sure termination problem is *undecidable* for $k$-d PCPs in general, yet *decidable* for $1$-d PCPs.
