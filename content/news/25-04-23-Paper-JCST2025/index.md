Our paper titled "[Parf: An Adaptive Abstraction-Strategy Tuner for Static Analysis](/publication/wang-jcst2025/)" by {{% mention "Zhongyi Wang" %}}, {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}}, {{% mention "Tengjie Lin" %}}, {{% mention "Linyu Yang" %}}, Junhao Zhuo, Qiuye Wang (Fermat Labs, Huawei Inc.), Shengchao Qin (Fermat Labs, Huawei Inc.), Xiao Yi (Fermat Labs, Huawei Inc.), and Jianwei Yin has been accepted for presentation at Journal of Computer Science and Technology (JCST 2025). This paper presents parf -- a toolkit for adaptively tuning abstraction strategies of static program analyzers in a fully automated manner. parf provides a web-based user interface facilitating the intuitive configuration of static analyzers and visualization of dynamic distribution refinement of the abstraction strategies.
