Our paper titled "[QuFEM: Fast and Accurate Quantum Readout Calibration Using the Finite Element Method](/publication/tan-asplos2024/)" by Siwei Tan, Hanyu Zhang, Jia Yu, Congliang Lang, Yongheng Shang, Xinkui Zhao, {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}}, Yun Liang (PKU), Liqiang Lu, and Jianwei Yin has been conditionally accepted with shepherding for presentation at ASPLOS 2024 -- the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems at San Diego, USA. This paper contributes a novel readout-calibration framework for reducing the impact of measurement errors in quantum programs.
