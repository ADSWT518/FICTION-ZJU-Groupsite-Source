Our paper titled "[UniGM: Unifying Multiple Pre-trained Graph Models via Adaptive Knowledge Aggregation](/publication/chen-acmmm2024/)" by Jintao Chen, Fan Wang, Shengye Pang, Siwei Tan, {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}}, Tiancheng Zhao, Meng Xi, and Jianwei Yin has been accepted for presentation at ACM MM 2024 -- the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia at Melbourne, Australia. This paper presents UniGM -- a framework for unifying multiple pre-trained graph models (GMs) via
adaptive knowledge aggregation, which makes one of the first attempts to unify multiple pre-trained GMs for better performance in downstream tasks.
