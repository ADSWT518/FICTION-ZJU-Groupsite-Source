Our paper titled "[Parf: Adaptive Parameter Refining for Abstract Interpretation](/publication/wang-ase2024/)" by {{% mention "Zhongyi Wang" %}}, {{% mention "Linyu Yang" %}}, {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}}, {{% mention "Yixuan Bu" %}}, {{% mention "Zhiyang Li" %}}, Qiuye Wang (Fermat Labs, Huawei Inc.), Shengchao Qin (Fermat Labs, Huawei Inc.), Xiao Yi (Fermat Labs, Huawei Inc.), and Jianwei Yin has been accepted for presentation at ASE 2024 -- the 39th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, at California, United States. This paper presents a novel framework called Parf for adaptively tuning external parameters of abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Parf is, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully automated approach that supports incremental refinement of such parameters.
