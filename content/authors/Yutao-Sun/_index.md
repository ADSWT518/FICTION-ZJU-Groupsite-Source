I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the [Formal Verification Group](/) under the co-supervision of Dr. Mingshuai Chen and Dr. [Jianwei Yin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0001038). My research interest lies in the general scope of service computing and regulation, where my aim is to develop a uniform framework for specifying and reasoning about multimodal service regulations.
