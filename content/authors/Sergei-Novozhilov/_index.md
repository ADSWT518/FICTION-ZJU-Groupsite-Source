I am currently a PhD student at HKUST, part of the [ALPACAS](https://amir.goharshady.com/alpacas-research-group) research group led by Dr. [Amir Goharshady](https://amir.goharshady.com/home). My research interests include formal verification, probabilistic systems, and applied parameterized graph algorithms. In the summer of 2024, I was on a research visit to the [Formal Verification Group](/).
