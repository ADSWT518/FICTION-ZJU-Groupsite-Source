I have been involved in an intern program at RWTH Aachen University during the second half of 2022. I worked on the topic of latticed Craig interpolation under the supervision of Dr. Mingshuai Chen, where we aim to apply the well-established technique of Craig interpolation to the verification of (possibly infinite-state) probabilistic programs encoding randomized algorithms.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Waterloo, Canada.
