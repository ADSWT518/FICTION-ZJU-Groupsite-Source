I am currently working on my Bachelor's thesis at the [Formal Verification Group](/) under the supervision of Dr. Mingshuai Chen. The goal of my research is to develop automated techniques for adaptively tuning parameters of static analyzers. I will join the group as a Ph.D. Candidate in September 2024.
