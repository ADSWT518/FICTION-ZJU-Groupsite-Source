The Formal Verification Group (FICTION), headed by Prof. Dr. [Mingshuai Chen](/author/mingshuai-chen/), is a research unit embedded in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University (ZJU), Hangzhou, China. We develop formal reasoning techniques for programs and hybrid discrete-continuous systems for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of safety-critical software systems while pushing the limits of automation as far as possible. Check out the [featured publications](/#featured) as examples of our research.

We are constantly on the hunt of self-motivated Postdocs, Ph.D./Master Students, and Research Assistants/Interns to join our group at ZJU. Check out the [open positions](/vacancies/) in case you are interested.
