## About Hangzhou

As one of China's most renowned and prosperous cities for much of the last millennium, Hangzhou has been long recognized as the "[Paradise on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou#Ancient_proverbs_about_Hangzhou)" -- landmarked by [West Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lake). It is a major economic and e-commerce hub within China, and in particular, a major city for scientific research in the Asia-Pacific, ranking [23rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_scientific_output) globally by scientific outputs. Hangzhou tops the list of Chinese cities of opportunity, for instance, Hangzhou is home to the headquarters of large global tech companies such as Alibaba Group, Ant Group, and NetEase.

## About the advisor

Prof. Dr. {{% mention "Mingshuai Chen" %}} is a ZJU100 Young Professor leading the [Formal Verification Group](https://fiction-zju.github.io/) at Zhejiang University. Prior to joining ZJU, he worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at RWTH Aachen University and a Visiting Researcher at University of Oldenburg, both in Germany. He received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019. His primary research interest lies in formal verification and synthesis, broadly construed in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science.

Mingshuai Chen has published over twenty peer-reviewed papers at flagship journals/conferences including Inf. Compt., IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr., CAV, TACAS, IJGAR, FM, etc. He serves in the reviewer panel of AMS Mathematical Reviews and the program/repeatability committees of SYNASC 2022, RTCSA 2021, VMCAI 2021, ADHS 2021, etc. He was the awardee of the Distinguished Paper Award at ATVA 2018, Best Paper Award at FMAC 2019, and the CAS-President Special Award in 2019 (1st awardee from ISCAS ever since its inception in 1985). Part of his research results has been successfully applied in the verification of control programs of the Chinese lunar lander Chang'e-3 and the Chinese high-speed railway system.

## Research topics

Our research group aims to develop **formal reasoning techniques** for programs and hybrid discrete-continuous systems for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of safety-critical software systems while pushing the limits of **automation** as far as possible. In general, we are interested in [**formal methods**](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-06410-9_4)[^note-FM] -- the rigorous mathematical basis of computer science. Concrete research directions include (yet not limited to):

* **Logical Aspects of Computer Science**
* **Formal Verification and Synthesis**
* **Programming Theory/Languages**
* **Model Checking and Theorem Proving**
* **Cyber-Physical Systems**
* **Probabilistic/Quantum Systems**
* **Verification Meets AI/ML**

<i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Check out Mingshuai Chen's [research statement](/files/Research%20Statement_Mingshuai%20Chen.pdf) for more details on these directions.

[^note-FM]: Formal methods have long been at the heart of computer science; there are 12 [Turing Award Recipients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award#Recipients) -- the most amongst all the sub-fields of computer science.


## What do we expect?

* Solid background in computer science, mathematics, software, control theory, or related areas. Knowledge in (a subset of) the following lectures is preferred:
  - Undergraduate level: Automata Theory, Compiler Construction, Programming Languages, Differential Equations, and Discrete Mathematics.
  - Graduate level: Mathematical Logic, Theory of Computation/Programming, Program Analysis/Verification, Formal Semantics, Model Checking, SAT/SMT Solving, Theorem Proving, Decision Procedures, Computer Algebra, Symbolic Computation, Game Theory, and Process Algebra.
  - Mathematics and Control: Algebra, Optimization, Probability Theory, Stochastic Processes, Differential Geometry, and Optimal Control.
* Passion and endurance for solving challenging (mathematical) research problems.
* Research experience in the above-mentioned topics is a plus, yet not a requisite (except for Postdoc applicants).


## What you can expect?

Our overall goal of teaching and advising is to assist the students in developing interests and independent, critical thinking skills for approaching fundamental principles in theoretical computer science. We position ourselves as coaches and co-learners in an inclusive community consisting of the supervisor, the students, the colleagues, and the world around us. <i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Check out Mingshuai Chen's [teaching statement](/files/Teaching%20Statement_Mingshuai%20Chen.pdf) for more details.

* **Research:** We are committed to providing students with a pure, free scientific research environment. The supervisor is deeply involved in the student's full-cycle research work ranging from literature review, topic assessment, effort allocation, theory development, paper writing, to result presentation. We provide regular seminars to keep track of cutting-edge research outcomes. We constantly enjoy assisting students to develop their immature, yet creative ideas into solid research results (which we took more like collaborations than mentor-and-mentees). As an example, one of our mentees had co-authored two CAV papers already by the first two years of his graduate program.
* **Collaborations and Exchange:** We have been -- and will continue to be -- working on the aforementioned research topics in extensive collaborations with international research groups at, e.g., RWTH Aachen, Saarland, and Oldenburg in Germany; MIT, UNM, and CU Boulder in the US; DTU in Denmark; Radboud in the Netherlands; NTU in Singapore; ISCAS and PKU in China. We are keen to offer every Ph.D. student the opportunity of short/long-term exchange programs with one or more of these groups.
* **Wages**: We got sufficient funding to offer competitive packages!
