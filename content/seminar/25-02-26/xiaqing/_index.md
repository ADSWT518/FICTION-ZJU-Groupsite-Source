**Abstract**: First, we introduce Unikernels, a lightweight operating system architecture that compiles application logic with minimal library dependencies into a single address space, contrasting it with traditional monolithic and modular OS designs.  Additionally, we discuss DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit), a framework for high-performance packet processing in user space.

The second focus is on the evolution of formal verification tools developed by Prof. Caoâ€™s research group. We trace the progression from early verification frameworks to VST-A (Verified Software Toolchain-Advanced), a Coq-based system for proving functional correctness of C programs, as published in the landmark VST-A paper. Finally, we present the latest QCP tool, detailing its workflow for automating resource-aware verification through symbolic execution and constraint solving.
