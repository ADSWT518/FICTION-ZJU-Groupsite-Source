**Abstract**: In the domain of cyber-physical systems, there is an increasing relevance of data-driven approaches for the learning of hybrid system dynamics. In particular, accurate models have been successfully abstracted from continuous (real-valued) traces and applied for various goals. However, when it comes to hybrid systems with nonlinear dynamics and guards, there exists few methods, In this seminar, we will introduce our recent work on dealing with nonlinearity.
