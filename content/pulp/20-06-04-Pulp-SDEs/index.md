> "While writing my book [Stochastic Processes] I had an argument with Feller. He asserted that everyone said 'random variable' and I asserted that everyone said 'chance variable'. We obviously had to use the same name in our books, so we decided the issue by a stochastic procedure. That is, we tossed for it and he won."
