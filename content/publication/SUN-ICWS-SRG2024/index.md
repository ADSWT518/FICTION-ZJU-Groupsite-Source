abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly encroaching on the field of service regulation. This work-in-progress article presents the design principles behind <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horae</span>, a unified specification language to model multimodal regulation rules across a diverse set of domains. We show how <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horae</span> facilitates an intelligent service regulation pipeline by further exploiting a fine-tuned large language model named RuleGPT that automates the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horae</span> modeling process, thereby yielding an end-to-end framework for fully automated intelligent service regulation.
